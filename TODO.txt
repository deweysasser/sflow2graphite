TODO:  
 * Create a method to normalize total CPU by # of CPUs -- this
   requires 2 levels of calualtion and thus implies either general
   expression evaluation or dependency ordering of synthetic
   calculations.
 * We're not sending through metrics on the first data point because
   we can't calculate the synthetics.  Fix this so we always send
   through non-synthetics.
