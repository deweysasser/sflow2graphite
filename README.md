sflow2graphite
==============

My branch of https://code.google.com/p/sflow2graphite/ for bug fixes and enhancements.

Changes from the original:

* supports and optional prefix for all metrics ('sflow.')
* a generic mechanism for handling calculated metrics
* calculated disk read and write latencies
* calculated cpu total ms (sum of user, system, and wio)
* added a verbose flag
